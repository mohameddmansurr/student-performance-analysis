# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes and predicts student performance using Python in Jupyter Notebook. It involves **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **machine learning model training**.

---

## 📂 Files in This Repository

* **`StudentPerformanceFactors.csv`** – Dataset containing student performance details.
* **`Student Score Prediction.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook with:

  * Data preprocessing
  * Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  * Model training and evaluation
* **`README.md`** – Project documentation.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohameddmansurr/student-performance-analysis.git
```

### 2️⃣ Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd student-performance-analysis
```

### 3️⃣ Open Jupyter Notebook

If Jupyter is installed:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Student Score Prediction.ipynb"
```

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Import Libraries** – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
2. **Load Dataset** – Read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** –

   * Visualize distributions and relationships.
   * Identify trends affecting performance.
5. **Model Training** – Train regression models to predict student scores.
6. **Model Evaluation** – Measure performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² score.
